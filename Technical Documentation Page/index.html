    <p> CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages,
    but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is, with a simple syntax example, 
    and also covers some key terms about the language.</p>

    <p> CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.
    A document is usually a text file structured using a markup language — HTML is the most common markup language, but you 
    may also come across other markup languages such as SVG or XML.</p>

    <p>Presenting a document to a user means converting it into a form usable by your audience. Browsers, like Firefox, 
    Chrome, or Edge , are designed to present documents visually, for example, on a computer screen, projector or printer.</p>

    <p>CSS can be used for very basic document text styling — for example changing the color and size of headings and links. 
    It can be used to create layout — for example turning a single column of text into a layout with a main content area 
    and a sidebar for related information. It can even be used for effects such as animation. </p>

    <ul>
    <li> Basic computer literacy </li>

    <article>
    <p> CSS is a rule-based language — you define rules specifying groups of styles that should be applied to particular elements or groups of elements on your web page. 
    For example "I want the main heading on my page to be shown as large red text." </p>

    <p> The following code shows a very simple CSS rule that would achieve the styling described above: </p>

    <pre>
    <code>
    h1 {
    color: red;
    font-size: 5em;
    }
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p> The rule opens with a selector . This selects the HTML element that we are going to style. In this case we are styling level one headings (&lt;h1&gt;).
        We then have a set of curly braces { }. Inside those will be one or more declarations, which take the form of property and value pairs. 
        Each pair specifies a property of the element(s) we are selecting, then a value that we'd like to give the property. </p>

    <p>Before the colon, we have the property, and after the colon, the value. CSS properties have different allowable values, 
        depending on which property is being specified. In our example, we have the color property, which can take various color values.
        We also have the font-size property. This property can take various size units as a value. </p>

    <p> A CSS stylesheet will contain many such rules, written one after the other. </p>

    
    <pre>
    <code>
    h1 {
    color: red;
    font-size: 5em;
    }

    p {
    color: black;
    }
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p> You will find that you quickly learn some values, whereas others you will need to look up.
    The individual property pages on MDN give you a quick way to look up properties and their values when you forget,
    or want to know what else you can use as a value. </p>

    <section id="Changing_the_default_behavior_of_elements" class="main-section">
    <header>Changing the default behavior of elements</header>
    <article>

    <p>When we look at a well-marked up HTML document, even something as simple as our example, we can see how the browser 
    is making the HTML readable by adding some default styling. Headings are large and bold and our list has bullets.
    This happens because browsers have internal stylesheets containing default styles, which they apply to all pages by default; 
    without them all of the text would run together in a clump and we would have to style everything from scratch.
    All modern browsers display HTML content by default in pretty much the same way. </p>

    <p>However, you will often want something other than the choice the browser has made. 
    This can be done by choosing the HTML element that you want to change, and using a CSS rule to change the way it looks. 
    A good example is our &lt;ul&gt;, an unordered list. It has list bullets, and if I decide I don't want those bullets I can remove them like so: </p>
    
    <pre>
    <code>
    li{
    list-style-type: none;
    }
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>Try adding this to your CSS now. <br> The list-style-type property is a good property to look at on MDN 
        to see which values are supported. Take a look at the page for list-style-type and you will find 
        an interactive example at the top of the page to try some different values in, then all allowable values are detailed further down the page.

    <header> Styling things based on their location in a document </header>
    <article>
    <p>There are times when you will want something to look different based on where it is in the document. 
        There are a number of selectors that can help you here, but for now we will look at just a couple. In our document, 
        assume there are two &lt;em&gt; elements — one inside a paragraph and the other inside a list item. To select only an &lt;em&gt; that
        is nested inside an &lt;li&gt; element I can use a selector called the descendant combinator, which takes the form of a space between two other selectors.

        <br> Add the following rule to your stylesheet.

    </p>

    <pre>
    <code>
    li em {
    color: rebeccapurple;
    }
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p> This selector will select any &lt;em&gt; element that is inside (a descendant of) an &lt;li&gt;.
    So in your example document, you should find that the &lt;em&gt; in the third list item is now purple, but the one inside the paragraph is unchanged.</p>

    <p> Something else you might like to try is styling a paragraph when it comes directly after a heading at the same hierarchy level in the HTML. 
    To do so place a + (an adjacent sibling combinator) between the selectors. <br>

    Try adding this rule to your stylesheet as well:

    </p>
    
    <pre>
    <code>
    h1 + p {
    font-size: 200%;
    }
    </code>
    </pre>

    <section id="Styling_things_based_on_state" class="main-section">
    <header> Styling things based on state</header>
    <article>
    <p> The final type of styling we shall take a look at in this tutorial is the ability to style things based on their state.
    A straightforward example of this is when styling links. When we style a link we need to target the &lt;a&gt; (anchor) element.
    This has different states depending on whether it is unvisited, visited, being hovered over, focused via the keyboard, 
    or in the process of being clicked (activated). You can use CSS to target these different states — the CSS below styles unvisited links
    pink and visited links green.</p>

    <pre>
    <code>

    a:link {
    color: pink;
    }

    a:visited {
    color: green;
    }

    </code>
    </pre>

    <p> You can change the way the link looks when the user hovers over it, for example by removing the underline, which is achieved by the next rule: </p>

    <pre>
    <code>

    a:hover {
    text-decoration: none;
    }
    </code>
    </pre>

    <section id="Applying_CSS_to_HTML" class="main-section">
    <header>Applying CSS to HTML</header>

    <article>
    <p> First, let's examine three methods of applying CSS to a document:
    with an external stylesheet, with an internal stylesheet, and with inline styles.</p>

    <h3> External stylesheet </h3>
    <p> An external stylesheet contains CSS in a separate file with a .css extension. 
    This is the most common and useful method of bringing CSS to a document. You can link a single CSS file to multiple web pages, 
    styling all of them with the same CSS stylesheet. In the Getting started with CSS, we linked an external stylesheet to our web page.
    You reference an external CSS stylesheet from an HTML &lt;link&gt; element:
    </p>
    <pre>
    <code>
        &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
        &lt;html&gt;
        &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
        &lt;title>My CSS experiment&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"&gt;
        &lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is my first CSS example&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/body&gt;
        &lt;/html&gt;
    </code>
    </pre>
    
    <p>The href attribute of the &lt;link&gt; element needs to reference a file on your file system. In the example above, 
    the CSS file is in the same folder as the HTML document, but you could place it somewhere else and adjust the path. </p>

    <h3> Internal stylesheet </h3>
    <p> An internal stylesheet resides within an HTML document. To create an internal stylesheet, 
        you place CSS inside a &lt;style&gt; element contained inside the HTML &lt;head&gt; </p>
        
    <p>The HTML for an internal stylesheet might look like this:</p>

    <pre>
    <code>
        
        &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
        &lt;html&gt;
        &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
        &lt;title>My CSS experiment&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;style&gt;
        h1 { 
        color: blue;
        background-color: yellow;
        border: 1px solid black;
        }

        p {
        color: red;
        }
       &lt;/style&gt;
        &lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;This is my first CSS example&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/body&gt;
        &lt;/html&gt;

    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>In some circumstances, internal stylesheets can be useful. For example, perhaps you're working with a content management system 
        where you are blocked from modifying external CSS files. <br> But for sites with more than one page, an internal stylesheet becomes a less efficient way
         of working. To apply uniform CSS styling to multiple pages using internal stylesheets, you must 
         have an internal stylesheet in every web page that will use the styling. 
         The efficiency penalty carries over to site maintenance too. With CSS in 
         internal stylesheets, there is the risk that even one simple styling change may require edits to multiple web pages.
    </p>

    <h3> Inline styles </h3>
    <p> Inline styles are CSS declarations that affect a single HTML element, contained within a style attribute. 
        The implementation of an inline style in an HTML document might look like this: </p>

    <pre>
    <code>

        &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
        &lt;html&gt;
        &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;meta charset="utf-8"&gt;
        &lt;title>My CSS experiment&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css"&gt;
        &lt;/head&gt;
        &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1 style="color: blue;background-color: yellow;border: 1px solid black;"&gt;Hello World!&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p style="color:red;"&gt;This is my first CSS example&lt;/p&gt;
        &lt;/body&gt;
        &lt;/html&gt;

    </code>
    </pre>

    <p> Avoid using CSS in this way, when possible. It is the opposite of a best practice. First, it is the least efficient implementation of CSS for maintenance. 
        One styling change might require multiple edits within a single web page. 
        Second, inline CSS also mixes (CSS) presentational code with HTML and content, making everything more difficult to read and understand. 
        Separating code and content makes maintenance easier for all who work on the website.
        <br>
        There are a few circumstances where inline styles are more common. You might have to resort to using inline styles if
        your working environment is very restrictive. For example, perhaps your CMS only allows you to edit the HTML body. 
        You may also see a lot of inline styles in HTML email to achieve compatibility with as many email clients as possible.

    <section id="Functions" class="main-section">
    <header>Functions</header>
    <article>
    
    <p> While most values are relatively simple keywords or numeric values, there are some 
        values that take the form of a function. An example would be the calc() function, which can do simple math within CSS:
    </p>

    <pre>
    <code>
        &lt;div class="outer"&gt;&lt;div class="box"&gt;The inner box is 90% - 30px.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
    </code>
    </pre>

    <pre>
    <code>
    .outer {
    border: 5px solid black;
    }
      
    .box {
    padding: 10px;
    width: calc(90% - 30px);
    background-color: rebeccapurple;
    color: white;
    }
    </code>
    </pre>

    <p>A function consists of the function name, and parentheses to enclose the values for the function. 
        In the case of the calc() example above, the values define the width of this box to be 90% of 
        the containing block width, minus 30 pixels. The result of the calculation isn't something that 
        can be computed in advance and entered as a static value.
        
        Another example would be the rotate() function. Other examples include functions for tranform, linear gradients or for color, 
        in particular rgb/rgba/hsl/hsla values.
